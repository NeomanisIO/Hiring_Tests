# Test 3

Thematic : Senior Dev Evaluation

## Context

Exercises 1 and 2 have been prepared for beginners. If you have a senior profile we would like to add additional instructions.

The exercise of your choice must be made packaged / packageable in a Docker container (or Docker-compose, Vagrant, etc). Its deployment must be easy for our tests and therefore correctly documented.

Depending on the exercise chosen, we would like you to choose a topic that we will talk about more during the interview in this list, directly related or not to the exercise:
- Application security
- Testing (not only unit tests)
- Micro-services architecture
- JS cross-platform desktop app (using framework such as Electron)

For this last point we do not want a long and formal presentation. We want you to be able to show us your know-how and your knowledge on topics that interest us and that could be important to you.
